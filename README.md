## About Me
I build data systems that connect sensors, the cloud, and end-users. My work spans:
- Data ingestion and ETL pipelines
- Machine learning deployment and MLOps
- Cloud-native architectures (Google Cloud, AWS)
- Interactive dashboards and decision intelligence
- Bioinformatics and diagnostics innovation

Currently, I serve as Co-Founder & Chief Data Officer at [Krado](https://www.krado.co), where I lead the development of IoT-to-cloud pipelines for sustainable agriculture and plant care.
